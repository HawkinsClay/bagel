## Introduction 

The Rosetta interface Foldit was used to design mutations that were predicted to maintain or improve protein stability. 

A simple assay was used to measure the rate of the reaction.

A multiple sequence alignment of XXXX related proteins reveals XX conserved residues.

## Results 

#### Table 1. Mutants expressing less than 0.165 mg/mL protein.

#### Figure. Cartoon representation of Bagel with residues critical for protein folding colored red. 

A colorized map of the enzyme showing the amino acid positions at which the native residue is critical for folding reveals that most of the mutants have a mutation that removes an aromatic residue from the interior of the protein. Two notable exceptions, XXX and XXX, remain unexplained. 

### Alanine scan of protein-ligand interface

To conduct an alanine scan of the protein-ligand interface, we chose 40 residues having an atom within 12 A of the ligand. Each of these resides was in turn mutated to alanine and the kinetic parameters of the result mutant assayed as described. 

Mutant E164A, where the catalytic glutamate E164 has been replaced with alanine, has a kcat about 8000 times less than the WT.

## Conclusions

### Alanine scan, effects on kcat

Residues E164 and W399 are critical for catalytic function. While 164 is predicted to act as a nucleophile, a role for W399 remains  mysterious. 

### Alanine scan, effects on KM

The mutation W120A enables an alternative substrate binding mode. This results in a decrease in K_M because the substrate has an additional possible catalytically-productive binding mode compared to the wild type without the mutation/with the W//. 

### Modeling predicts stability with high confidence 

Molecular modeling of the mutants with Rosetta indicates that we can predict protein stability with high confidence (R-squared of > 0.8) using the Rosetta metric XXXXXXXX. 

## Materials & Methods 

### Design 

### Mutagenesis 

Mutants of ß-glucosidase B in pET29b(+) were constructed using Kunkel mutagenesis. 

### Growth, expression and purification

Plasmids were transformed into _E. coli_ BL21DE3, grown for 24 hours at 37 C in 5 mL TB cultures. 


### Kinetic data collection and analysis 

Rates in OD/min were obtained in triplicate for each mutant for 8 substrate concentrations: 100, 75, ... 0 mM. Rates were converted to 1/min by scaling to protein concentration and fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation (kobs=kcat*S/(km+S)). Those with error were fit to determine overall efficiency (kcat/km).
