## Intro

p1. The beta glucosidases > importtant to understand this class of enzymes function. Very limited information on an extesnive set of mutations.

Figure 1. Reaction scheme 

p2. This specific BglB (organism, PDB, etc) was crystalized with a transition state analog 

The _ß-glucosidase_ used from this study is derived from _Paenibacillus polymyxa_,
a motile, Gram-positive bacterium found in soils and marine sediments.
A recombinant protein was crystallized with the substrate analog
2-deoxy-2-fluoro-alpha-D-glucopyranose and the structure solved to 2.3
Å (Isorna 2007). 

PDB ID: 2JIE with functional constraints imposed by the
catalytic mechanism was used to build a molecular model of BglB in
Rosetta.

p3. What we did 

First, we performed an alanine scan of the active site. A mutant was
generated for each residue within 12 Å of the active site with that residue
mutated to alanine. A further set of mutants was designed in Foldit. These
mutants were predicted to be stable proteins and to have a variety of
effects on catalysis and binding. We produced, purified, and assayed each
mutant to obtain kinetic constants. 

Our results, while consistent with the enzyme mechanism, reveal surprises. 

## Results

p1. x number were a systematic alanine scan, y were design using Foldit. How designed and how chosen. 

p2. After seq ver of each mutant, Each protein was produced and purified such that > 80% pure. Each sample was kinetically analyzed and mm constants obtained. Batches of x were done at a time, with a wild type in each batch. 

p3. Wild type variation observed (+ sup figures) 

p4. To evaluate the conservation, wich is oftenlinked to sutractal inprtantce, we got a msa, analazyed each sition, and depected as a seq logog on top of table 1.

p3. Did the MSA match up with our data? 

p4. Unexpected: functional hotspot r vs e

## Materials & Methods

### Molecular modeling and design

Molecular models of ß-glucosidase B were created from PDB ID 2JIE.
A transition state model of 4-nitrophenyl-ß-D-glucoside was docked into the
crystal structure using functional constraints imposed by the enzyme
mechanism. The Rosetta front-end Foldit was used to make mutations. 

### Mutagenesis, expression, and purification 

Mutant plasmids were constructed using Kunkel mutagenesis (cite?) by
Transcriptic. Sequence-verified plasmids were transformed into BLR.
Small-scale (5 mL) cultures were grown to saturation, pelleted, switched to
induction medium containing 100 mM IPTG, and allowed to express at 18 C for
24 hours before harvesting. 

Proteins were purified over Ni-NTA resin (50 uL bed volume) and eluted in
25 mM EDTA.
