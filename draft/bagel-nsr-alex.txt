# Protein engineering and kinetic characterization of a family 1 glycoside hydrolase  

## Introduction

Family 1 glycoside hydrolases have broad substrate specificity for ß-glycosidic linkages and are essential to the life of every organism. They also find industrial/commercial use in the hydrolysis of plant biomass into glucose as the final step in a pathway that breaks down complex carbohydrates into simple sugars. This family of enzymes has been the subject of numerous structural and kinetic studies. However, it is often difficult to directly compare experimental data collected by many groups in many different settings.  

BglB, the ß-glucosidase used from this study, is derived from Paenibacillus polymyxa, a motile, Gram-positive bacterium found in soils and marine sediments. BglB follows a classical Koshland double-displacement mechanism in which Glu 164 performs a nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon of the substrate’s glucose moiety. The leaving group (in natural systems, another sugar) is protonated by Glu 353. Tyr 295 orients the Glu 353 for catalysis. An X-ray crystal structure of BglB was published in 2007 [Isorna]. 

Here, we report kinetic constants for over 100 single amino acid switch mutants of BglB comprising a set of computationally-designed mutants and a systematic alanine scan of the protein-ligand interface. All the mutants were produced, purified, and assayed in a consistent manner, making this the largest collection of kinetic constants for a single enzyme ever determined.  

## Results

### Computationally-directed engineering of BglB 

In our study, a macromolecular model of BglB was constructed based on a crystal structure (PDB ID: 2JIE) and engineered using the software Foldit, a graphical front-end to Rosetta. Hypothesis-driven mutations were designed and scored using Foldit, with the requirement that the overall protein energy remain the same or improve with the mutation. 

### Mutant protein yields 

It is well known that even single amino acid switch mutations can dramatically decrease protein stability, leading to improper folding. Previous studies using random mutagenesis have reported that about 90% of random mutants produce insoluble protein. In contrast, our study, in which mutants were generated within the context of a physically-realistic scoring function, greater than 90% of designed structures expressed active, soluble protein. The mean expression level for this data set was 1 mg/mL.  

### Kinetic characterization of mutants

In this study, Michaelis-Menten kinetic constants for mutants comprising a systematic alanine scan of the protein-ligand interface, together with a set of computationally-designed mutants, were obtained to under 25% error. 

Many of the mutations result in wild type–like kinetic constants. Mutations which replace well-known catalytic residues with alanine reduce catalytic efficiency to below our limit of detection (10/min). 

### Kinetic data in light of conservation data 

We discovered a number of interesting relationships between structure and function in our study. 

## Discussion

In this work, over 100 computationally-designed mutants of a family 1 glucosidase were kinetically characterized. While many of the mutations, particularly those in which a conserved catalytic residue is mutated to alanine, have readily predictable effects, some reveal surprises in how the structure of this enzyme determines its function. 

One ancillary result of our work was the identification of residues that are not conserved which are nonetheless critical for efficient catalysis. In particular, Glu 222 proved to be essential for catalytic hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl-ß-D-glucoside. This residue is not strongly conserved in family 1 glucosidases, yet a functional knockout results in a properly-folded enzyme which nonetheless has a kcat/KM less than 10/min, more than 15,000 times less than the wild type enzyme. Conversely, R240A, which is predicted to stabilize an alternate conformation of Glu 222 which brings the carboxylic acid moiety to within 4.5 Å of the leaving group (from an original distance of 6.5 Å) has a kcat which is 100-fold faster than WT, and a kcat/KM 10-fold greater. While a crystal structure will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis, our molecular modeling is consistent with our experimental results in establishing a critical role for Glu 222. It is unclear and perhaps counterintuitive why the interaction between Glu 222 and the nitro group of 4-nitrophenol stabilizes this species as a leaving group. 

To the best of our knowledge this is the largest data set of mutant enzymes produced and kinetically characterized in a uniform manner. While no specific physical features were being probed, we have uncovered a significant functional importance of non-conserved amino acids for the tested substrate through this broad search. We believe this type of data set will be invaluable for the future development of computational enzyme engineering algorithms.  

## Materials and Methods

### Molecular modeling and design

Molecular models of ß-glucosidase B were created from PDB ID 2JIE,  [also need Uniprot number], a recombinant protein crystallized with the substrate analog 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-alpha-D-glucopyranose and solved to 2.3 Å [Isorna 2007].  A transition state model of 4-nitrophenyl-ß-D-glucoside was created in Spartan and docked into the crystal structure using functional constraints imposed by the enzyme mechanism. The Rosetta front-end Foldit was used to design in silico mutations. 

### Mutagenesis, expression, and purification 

Sequence-verified plasmids constructed via Kunkel mutagenesis (Transcrptic) were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen). Small-scale (5 mL) cultures in terrific broth were grown to saturation, pelleted, and resuspended in induction medium (terrific broth containing 0.1 M IPTG (Sigma)). Cultures were allowed to express at 18 C for 24 hours before harvesting. Proteins were purified via immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (50 uL bed volume of Ni-NTA (HisPur) resin, wash buffer: 15 mM imidazole, 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM sodium chloride) and eluted in four bed volumes of elution buffer (25 mM EDTA, 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM sodium chloride). Protein concentration was determined by the ratio of absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm (BioTek Epoch) and confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Life Technologies). 

### Assay and data analysis 

Mutant proteins were assayed in 100 uL reactions containing 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM sodium chloride, 25 mM EDTA, and serial dilutions of substrate at concentrations from 75 mM to 0 mM. Rate of product (4-nitrophenol) formation was monitored by absorbance at 420 nm. The observed rates were to fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using SciPy [cite]. 

### Multiple sequence alignment 

A multiple sequence alignment of ~12,000 sequences of the Pfam collection of family 1 glucoside hydrolases to BglB was performed using the MAFFT algorithm after hand-curation of sequences between 350 and 650 amino acids in length.
