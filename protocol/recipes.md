Day 0 is the day for making the stock solutions that you will use throughout the five-day procedure. 

### LB plates with kanamycin (25 plates)

Autoclave 250 mL water with 2 pellets of LB agar in a 500 mL bottle. After autoclaving, hold in 50 C dry bath until 50 C, then add 250 μL 1000X kanamycin solution. Use a serological pipet to pour 10 mL per plate

### Lysis mix (100 reactions)

Combine 80 mg lysozyme, 10 mg DNAse, and 10 mg PMSF in a Falcon tube and shake well to combine

### Terrific broth (TB) (250 mL)

Dissolve 12.5 g dry Terrific Broth in 250 mL water and autoclave

### 1 M isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (1000X IPTG) (10 mL) 

Dissolve 240 mg IPTG in 1 mL wash buffer. Store 25 μL aliquots at –20 C

### Wash buffer (1 L)

Dissolve 11.9 g HEPES, 8.7 g sodium chloride, and 0.68 g imidazole in water and adjust pH to 7.50

### Protein buffer (1 L)

Dissolve 11.9 g HEPES, 8.7 g sodium chloride, and 7.31 g EDTA in water and adjust pH to 7.50

### 0.1 M 4-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (substrate) (100 mL)

Dissolve 3.01 g 4-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside in 100 mL protein buffer. Store 1.25 mL aliquots at –20 C
