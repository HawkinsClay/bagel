In Foldit:

When you make a mutation, wiggle, etc, quickly calculate the predicted kcat and km. 

It would as simple as running the enzdes score on the current pose and then calculating

kcat = ( 1 ) ( total_polar_contacts ) + ( 0.92 ) ( dsasa ) + ( 0.53 ) ( ... 

km = ( 1 ) ( packstat ) + ( 0.54 ) ( SR_X_fa_rep ) + ( ... 

where the weights are those identified by the machine learning algorithm in Carlin 2015. 

The algorithm is mutates a residue, calculates the predicted kcat and km, and if the 
data is predicted to be informative, submits a run to transcriptic to generate, express, 
purify, and assay the mutant. The data is added to the set and the algorithm selects a 
new residue to mutate. 

Every dozen or so mutants, machine learning attempts selection of additional features and 
cleans out marginal features. Features remain human-selected and physically-realistic.
