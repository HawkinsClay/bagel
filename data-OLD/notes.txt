#notes
c167n+w120r doesn't fit linear or MM, noisy data (toss)
d403a noisy, but looks like a MM fit 
e164a remove 1 outlier (~0.02, ~0.34) 
e222a substrate inhibition
e406a clean up and fit linear 
e426s remove 1 outlier (0.075, 150)
e53a linear
f405a looks like all three at s=0.012 are too high, remove?
f415a remove 1 outlier (~0, 3.75)
i91e needs to be cleaned up, 2 opposing outliers 
m323k seriously noisy, maybe toss
n220d+n293d good R^2 on linear fit but looks MM to me (borderline)
p329w interesting mutant, noisy (toss?)
q19a remove 1 outlier (0.025, ~0)
s16a noisy, toss?
s17a noisy MM fit, what's going on with measurements at highest sub conc.?
t178r looks like data from 2 different enz. concentrations
t218a remove 1 outlier (0.025, ~110)
v140s remove 1 outlier (0.025, ~12)
w120a looks MM to me, stat says linear 
w325a substrate inhibition? 
w34a noisy as hell
w402c looks MM to be, but stat says linear 
w407q noisy, no activity?
w407q dupe, noisy, substrate inhibition?
w407r noisy, linear 
w409a noisy MM
y168p substrate inhibition?
y18a MM fit looks OK to me
y295a noisy MM
y295g activity < LOD
w120h should be MM fit 
w399c should be MM fit, hardly saturating KM?
w399g activity < LOD
w399s 1 outlier at (~0, ~0.13)
