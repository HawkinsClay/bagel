1. Export from Google Doc to Numbers (> .xls)
2. Export from Numbers (> folder full of .csv)
3. Intelligently cat .csvs together > master.csv

3. Run stat on this or start from master.csv
4. For each line in master.csv, append corresponding line in score.sc

Ideas on how to do this:
  
  + awk: read through first file

    FNR==NR { }

    load lines into array 

    a[$NR] = $0

    read through second file

    { } 

    and 

    if the description column of first file matches anywhere in second file
    
    /$description_column/ ~ a[$NR]

    print both lines next to each other 

    print a[$NR], $0

    > data.csv
